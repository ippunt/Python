1. Testing     numbers and printing output dependant on odd,even, number range constraints. 
2. Division    divider operator, float division and modulus division.
3. Matrices    Linear algebra with infinite solutions is a scenario where you use a matrices

1. Lesson: If, elif with no else. 
    Could this be done without if else statements?
Given an integer, , perform the following conditional actions:

If  is odd, print Weird
If  is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Not Weird
If  is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Weird
If  is even and greater than , print Not Weird


Solution:
#!/bin/python3

import math
import os
import random
import re
import sys

if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input().strip())
if n%2!=0:
    print("Weird")
    
elif n%2==0 and n < 6 and n >1:
    print("Not Weird")
    
elif n%2==0 and n > 6 and n <21:
    print("Weird")
elif  n%2==0 and n>20:
    print("Not Weird")

From hackerrank comments not my original work but fun to evalute and learn:
n = int(input().strip())
check = {True: "Not Weird", False: "Weird"}

print(check[
        n%2==0 and (
            n in range(2,6) or 
            n > 20)
    ])

2)
// integer division, / float division,  % modulus remainder

>>> 3/10
0.3
>>> 10/3
3.3333333333333335
>>> 3//10
0
>>> 10//3
3
>>> 3%10
3
>>> 10%3  # This is usually desired affect gather the remainder. That is what modulus does. 
1
>>> 
>>> 3%100
3
