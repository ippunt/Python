1. Use the: if __name__ == '__main__':



1.
  This will ensure you are not running a library. 
  Script:
print ("Always executed")
 
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print ("Executed when invoked directly")
else:
    print ("Executed when imported")
EOF

Advantages:
Every Python module has it’s __name__ defined and if this is ‘__main__’, it implies that the module is being run standalone by the user and we can do corresponding appropriate actions.
If you import this script as a module in another script, the __name__ is set to the name of the script/module.
Python files can act as either reusable modules, or as standalone programs.
if __name__ == “main”: is used to execute some code only if the file was run directly, and not imported.
