1. It seems pty comes by default and can spawn bash terminal from python interpreter.
You can call bash scripts from python but this will give you bash within the python terminal. 

python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
  
-c command | arguments

Comes with Python as I have not installed pty

jdarling@ubuntu:~$ python3
