Guarded Clauses Technique
You do not want unmanageable nested Ifs
This is not Python

1. Bade Code:

void myfunct() {
  if (wifi) {
    if (login) {
      if (admin) {
        seeadminpanel();
      } else {
        debug print('Must be admin, attempted non admin')
        }
    } else {
        debugPrint('Must login')
        }
  } else {
      debugPrint('Must be connected to wifi')
      }
 }
 
2. Good Code:

void myfunct() {
  if (!wifi) {
    debugPrint('Must be connected to wifi')
    return;
  }
  if (!login) {
    debugPrint('Must login')
    return;
  } 
  if (!admin) {
   debug print('Must be admin, attempted non admin')
   return;
   }
   seeAdminPanel();
   }
EOF
Note: In Python: We can use the return statement inside a function only. In Python, every function returns something. If there are no return statements, then it returns None. 
If the return statement contains an expression, it's evaluated first and then the value is returned.
Python would look more like: 
>>> if 1==1:    print("Hello")
... 
Hello
>>>
>>> a=1;b=2;print(a);print(b);
1
2
>>> # Semicolons only work for small statements won't work in if statement. 
    I guess usage like the BASH bomb made me think of this. 
    The Good code gives the idea that return kind of functions as a break in loop. That is what we may want. 
    Let's test in some python too see if we can get like behavior.
    Remember formatting: >>> def func1(): print("Hello,World!")
