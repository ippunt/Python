3. Multithreading 

Note: Quite often if you just run two you will see one then the other. 
So, I created 4 to showcase a little better that it can run the variables/ function concurrently. 
import threading 
class Messen er threadin . Thread 
def run(self): 
  for in range(12): 
    print(threading.current_thread().getName()) 
x = Messenger(name='Send out messages.')
y = Messenger(name='Receive messages.')
x = Messenger(name='z')
x = Messenger(name='a')
class and looks for a function called run. 
x. start()# Goes to  class and looks for a function called run.
y. start() 
z.start()
a.start()
